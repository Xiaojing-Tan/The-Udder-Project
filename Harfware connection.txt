1.Encoders
We set PA6, PA7, PA8 and PA9 as external interruppt(EXTI) to count the pulse from the encoder. 
For wrist encoder, PA6 is for channel A and PA7 is for channel B.
For motor encoder, PA8 is for channel A and PA9 is for channel B.

2.Button
PA7 is setted as ADC input. We need to connect this pin with the POS wire of the Button board.
